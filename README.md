# Typst PowerPoint Add-in

A PowerPoint taskpane add-in that renders Typst snippets to SVG via a Rust/WebAssembly engine and inserts them into slides. Each inserted shape carries the original Typst source in its alt text so you can reselect and update it later without losing positioning.

## How it works
- `engine/`: Rust crate compiled to WebAssembly with `wasm-bindgen`, wrapping Typst to produce SVG. A bundled math font is initialized at runtime.
- `web/`: Taskpane UI (`index.html` + `script.js`), manifest, and a simple HTTPS static server for local development. `script.js` compiles Typst, inserts/replaces shapes, and round-trips the Typst source from a shape's `altTextDescription`.

## Prerequisites
- PowerPoint with Office JS add-ins enabled.
- Node.js.
- `wasm-pack` installed (`cargo install wasm-pack`).
- A locally trusted HTTPS certificate for `localhost` (paths default to `web/certs/localhost.{crt,key}`).

## Setup
1) Install JS tooling (run once):
```bash
npm install
```
2) Build the Typst WASM bundle (outputs to `web/pkg/`):
```bash
npm run build:engine
```
3) Create and trust a `localhost` certificate (mkcert recommended):
```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert -cert-file web/certs/localhost.crt -key-file web/certs/localhost.key localhost
# or with OpenSSL:
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout web/certs/localhost.key -out web/certs/localhost.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
4) Start the HTTPS dev server (defaults to `https://localhost:3000`):
```bash
npm run dev
# optional env: PORT=3443 ROOT=/abs/path CERT=/path/to.crt KEY=/path/to.key
```
5) Point the manifest at your server if you change host/port (`web/manifest.xml` → `SourceLocation`).

## Sideload into PowerPoint
1. PowerPoint → File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Trusted Add-in Catalogs.  
2. Add a Shared Folder catalog pointing to this repo (where `web/manifest.xml` lives) and check “Show in Menu.” (this requires the folder to be shared as a network folder so that the Catalog URL will be something like `\\your-device\path\to\repo\web`)
3. Restart PowerPoint → Home → Add-ins → Advanced → pick the Typst add-in.  
4. Open the taskpane; wait for “Insert / Update” once WASM loads.

## Usage
- Enter Typst code (e.g. `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$`) and click **Insert / Update** to place an SVG on the current slide.
- Select an existing Typst-generated shape to automatically reload its source into the textbox, edit, and re-run Insert / Update to replace it in place (position preserved).
- Shapes are tagged with `altTextDescription` starting `TYPST:` plus the encoded source; math font is served from `web/assets/math-font.ttf` on the same origin.

## NPM scripts
- `npm run build:engine` — Build the Rust engine to WebAssembly into `web/pkg/`.
- `npm run dev` — HTTPS static server for local development (`web/dev-server.js`).
- `npm start` — Launch the Office add-in debugger with `web/manifest.xml`.
- `npm run stop` — Stop the Office add-in debugger.

## Tips
- If insertion silently fails, check the taskpane console for “Insert failed” or “WASM Load Error.”
- Ensure the built `pkg/typst_ppt_engine.js` and `.wasm` file stay in `web/pkg/`; the stub file must be replaced by the `wasm-pack` output.
- Keep the math font available at `/assets/math-font.ttf`; missing font can distort rendering.
